### Route Flow

```

```

### Navigation Components

  - Profile button (avatar with user initial)
  - Admin toggle button (when `showAdminToggle` prop is true)
- **Used in**: Dashboard, EmploymentTypeSelection, CVUpload, PersonalInfo

### State Management

The application uses React state for:
- Authentication status (`isAuthenticated`)
- User profile (`userProfile`)
- Selected employment type (`selectedEmploymentType`)

**TODO**: Consider implementing:
- Context API for global state
- Redux or Zustand for complex state management
- Persistent state (localStorage/sessionStorage)

### Future Routes (To Be Implemented)

- `/profile` - User profile page
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` - Admin user management
- `/admin/applications` - Admin application management
- `/applications` - User's submitted applications
- `/application/:id` - View specific application

### Route Protection

Routes are protected using conditional rendering in `App.jsx`:
- If user is not authenticated, redirect to `/login`
- Authentication state is managed in `App.jsx` (TODO: Move to Context/Redux)

### API Integration Reminders

See `src/config/api.js` for:
- API endpoint configuration
- API helper functions
- Integration TODO list
