The model\npredicts match outcomes with high accuracy and provides win probabilities after each over.\nIntegrated data visualization to show win/loss probabilities, runs scored, and wickets fallen\nover the course of an innings.\nThe final model was serialized using Pickle for deployment or future use.\n• CRIME RATE ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING\nTools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Machine\nLearning (K-Means, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM)\nDescription:\nDesigned and implemented a data-driven analytical model to explore and analyze the\ntrends in child-related crime rates across Indian states from 2001 to 2012. The project\nutilized clustering and classification techniques to identify crime patterns, outliers, and\nstate-wise crime severity levels.\nPerformed in-depth data preprocessing, feature encoding, and visualization to\nunderstand spatial and temporal crime distributions. Implemented K-Means clustering to\ngroup states based on their crime statistics and applied supervised learning algorithms—\nRandom Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to predict\ncrime rate clusters based on historical data.\nUsed bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps for visual storytelling, helping to highlight year-\nwise and state-wise crime fluctuations.\nCertificate\n• Python 101 For Data science From IBM Skills Build.\n• Data Analysis With Python From IBM Skills Build.	{"all_skills": ["android studio", "jupyter notebook", "leadership", "matplotlib", "python", "communication", "java", "git", "problem solving", "creative", "visual studio", "numpy", "mysql developer", "vs code"], "resume_role": "Software Developer", "work_history": [{"role": "RPA Developer Virtual Intern", "company": "UiPath", "end_date": "June 2024", "location": "Virtual", "is_current": 0, "start_date": "April 2024", "description": "Completed a structured virtual internship program focused on Robotic Process Automation using UiPath Studio.
